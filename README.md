# Red Black Tree Lecture Notes

These are the lecture notes I used along with a code demo of insertion.

## Running the Code Demo

To run the code demo, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warrenjkim/rbtree-lecture
```

Then `cd` into the directory:

```bash
cd rbtree-lecture/code
```

Once inside the directory, run:

```bash
make
```

to make the executable. By default, the output is set to `./rbt`. You can change the 
name of the executable in the `Makefile`. Now run the program:

```bash
./rbt
```

**Note:** Only insertion is implemented, since deletion was outside the scope of the lecture.
