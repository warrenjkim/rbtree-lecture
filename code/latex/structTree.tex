\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Structure representing a Red-\/\+Black \doxylink{structTree}{Tree}. 

This structure is used to maintain a Red-\/\+Black \doxylink{structTree}{Tree}. It encapsulates the root of the tree and the total number of nodes within the tree, providing a high-\/level interface for operations on the tree such as insertion, and search.

Pointer to the root node of the Red-\/\+Black \doxylink{structTree}{Tree}. It points to NULL when the tree is empty. \Hypertarget{structTree_acaff08be5a222d427f771bee46bff5e2}\label{structTree_acaff08be5a222d427f771bee46bff5e2}

{\footnotesize\ttfamily Tree\+::size}

The total number of nodes in the tree. This count helps in operations that may require knowledge of the tree\textquotesingle{}s size, such as balancing, validation, and traversal optimizations. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
